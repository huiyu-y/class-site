    <h1>Rei’s Drawing Garden</h1>

      <br>
      This website is a garden created by Rei’s little auntie in Sep 2021. Rei’s auntie starts to plant Rei’s drawings in this garden then.
      <br>
      This is a vast garden, but every drawing is planted with a limited resolution of 160*144px.

    <p>I enjoy the willfulness of the children’s drawings.

      This is an alien.
      This is the earth.

      I appreciate such a willful world that only exists in kid’s drawings, where the shadow is absent under the sun or the animals all in rainbow colors. I would never ask for logic or order in them. Because this willfulness is the evidence of
      imagination and humor, and I know the willfulness would eventually disappear one day when the kids grow up. Perhaps we all had such experience about realizing the rabbits we draw look the same as others: with four legs sitting on the ground,
      long
      white ears, and a round furry tail, but no longer with a tie or a cup of tea holding in ‘hands’. We would eventually become the grown-ups in the little prince that could only see “the hat” in his Drawing Number One. I wouldn’t like to see my
      niece rush to become a boring grown-up who only follow the norms and orders of the world.

      So when my sister sent me the drawings of my niece and I started to think about making an online archive for them, I decided to create a website as a garden where we can willfully plant her drawings in. The garden can grow day by day with her,
      and this space could be free from any rules or layouts in the shared online archive space such as Google drive or Dropbox. I feel like by putting them in their own quiet space without being dependent on today’s mainstream social networks, that
      willful aura which is only seen in children’s drawings could be best presented.

      Without second thought, I asked my sister to take good photos of each drawing and send the original file to me to start creating the archive. I spent most of my time thinking about how to design a unique layout for this virtual garden. But
      later,
      I started to think about if good-quality photography images are the best way to display these drawings to the world. So far, I naturally adapt the taste of the grown-ups about the image. Good images should be clear and in high resolution
      especially in the internet world we full of 4k we live in. However, I totally ignored how this kind of rich images anchored in systems of orders and conservative structure, which I meant to avoid when I created this website. I realized if I use
      the rich images as a format to present the drawings, no matter how free the layout is, the aura in the drawings is still restricted and degraded in such format.

      “ Grown-ups love figures. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you ‘’What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect
      butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? how many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. “
      — The Little Prince

      I also realized, the willfulness aura in my niece’s drawings doesn’t depend on the high resolutions or new technology. The lack of amount in poor image will not castrate the aura, but perhaps best present them.

      “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”

      Rei’s auntie decided to share <span class="h2-inline">( )%</span> of Rei’s drawing with the world in the garden, and leave the aura and energy present in the original drawings only in Rei’s home and in the heart of Rei’s beloved family.
      <br>
      <br>
      This garden is grown with the love from Rei’s mom, dad, little auntie, big auntie, grandma, and grandpa.
