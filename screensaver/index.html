        THE elevator continued its impossibly slow ascent. Or at least I imagined it was ascent. There was no telling for sure: it was so slow that all sense of direction simply vanished. It could have been going down for all I knew, or maybe it
        wasn't moving at all. But let's just assume it was going up. Merely a guess. Maybe I'd gone up twelve stories, then down three. Maybe I'd circled the globe. How would I know? Every last thing about this elevator was worlds apart from the
        cheap die-cut job in my apartment building, scarcely one notch up the evolutionary scale from a well bucket. You'd never believe the two pieces of machinery had the same name and the same purpose. The two were pushing the outer limits
        conceivable as elevators. First of all, consider the space. This elevator was so spacious it could have served as an office. Put in a desk, add a cabinet and a locker, throw in a kitchenette, and you'd still have room to spare. You might even
        squeeze in three camels and a mid-range palm tree while you were at it. Second, there was the cleanliness. Antiseptic as a brand-new coffin. The walls and ceiling were absolutely spotless polished stainless steel, the floor immaculately
        carpeted in a handsome moss-green. Third, it was dead silent. There wasn't a sound—literally not one sound—from the moment I stepped inside and the doors slid shut. Deep rivers run quiet. Another thing, most of the gadgets an elevator is
        supposed to have were missing. Where, for example, was the panel with all the buttons and switches? No floor numbers to press, no door open and door close, no emergency stop. Nothing whatsoever. All of which made me feel utterly defenseless.
        And it wasn't just no buttons; it was no indication of advancing floor, no posted capacity or warning, not even a manufacturer's name-plate. Forget about trying to locate an emergency exit. Here I was, sealed in. No way this elevator could
        have gotten fire department approval. There are norms for elevators after all. Staring at these four blank stainless-steel walls, I recalled one of Houdini's great escapes I'd seen in a movie. He's tied up in how many ropes and chains,
        stuffed into a big trunk, which is wound fast with another thick chain and sent hurtling, the whole lot, over Niagara Falls. Or maybe it was an icy dip in the Arctic Ocean. Given that I wasn't all tied up, I was doing okay; insofar as I
        wasn't clued in on the trick, Houdini was one up on me. Talk about not clued in, I didn't even know if I was moving or standing still. I ventured a cough, but it didn't echo anything like a cough. It seemed flat, like clay thrown against a
        slick concrete wall. I could hardly believe that dull thud issued from my own body. I tried coughing one more time. The result was the same. So much for coughing. I stood in that hermetically sealed vault for what seemed an eternity. The
        doors showed no sign of ever opening. Stationary in unending silence, a still life: Man in Elevator. I started to get nervous. What if the machinery had malfunctioned? Or suppose the elevator operator—assuming there was one in the
        building—forgot I was here in this box? People have lost track of me before. I strained to hear something, anything, but no sound reached my ears. I pressed my ear against the stainless-steel wall. Sure enough, not a sound. All I managed was
        to leave an outline of my ear on the cold metal. The elevator was made, apparently, of a miracle alloy that absorbed all noise. I tried whistling Danny Boy, but it came out like a dog wheezing with asthma. There was little left to do but lean
        up against a wall and count the change in my pockets. For someone in my profession, knowing how to kill time is as important a method of training as gripping rubber balls is for a boxer. Although, in any strict sense, it's not killing time at
        all. For only through assiduous repetition is it possible to redistribute skewed tendencies. I always come prepared with pockets full of loose change. In my right pocket I keep one-hundred- and five-hundred-yen coins, in my left fifties and
        tens. Oneyen and five-yen coins I carry in a back pocket, but as a rule these don't enter into the count. What I do is thrust my hands simultaneously into both pockets, the right hand tallying the hundreds and five-hundreds in tandem with the
        left hand adding up the fifties and tens. It's hard for those who've never attempted the procedure to grasp what it is to calculate this way, and admittedly it is tricky at first. The right brain and the left brain each keep separate tabs,
        which are then brought together like two halves of a split watermelon. No easy task until you get the hang of it. Whether or not I really do put the right and left sides of my brain to separate accounts, I honestly can't say. A specialist in
        neurophysiology might have insights to offer on the matter. I'm no neurophysiologist, however. All I know is that when I'm actually in the midst of counting, I feel like I'm using the right side and left side of my brain differently. And when
        I'm through counting, it seems the fatigue that sets in is qualitatively quite distinct from what comes with normal counting. For convenience sake, I think of it as right-brain-totals-rightpocket, left-brain-totals-left-pocket. On the whole,
        I think of myself as one of those people who take a convenience-sake view of prevailing world conditions, events, existence in general. Not that I'm such a blase, convenience-sake sort of guy—although I do have tendencies in that
        direction—but because more often than not I've observed that convenient approximations bring you closest to comprehending the true nature of things. For instance, supposing that the planet earth were not a sphere but a gigantic coffee table,
        how much difference in everyday life would that make? Granted, this is a pretty farfetched example; you can't rearrange facts of life so freely. Still, picturing the planet earth, for convenience sake, as a gigantic coffee table does in fact
        help clear away the clutter—those practically pointless contingencies such as gravity and the international dateline and the equator, those nagging details that arise from the spherical view. I mean, for a guy leading a perfectly ordinary
        existence, how many times in the course of a lifetime would the equator be a significant factor? But to return to the matter at hand—or rather, hands, the right and the left each going about its own separate business—it is by no means easy to
        keep running parallel counts. Even for me, to get it down took the longest time. But once you do, once you've gotten the knack, it's not something you lose. Like riding a bike or swimming. Which isn't to say you can't always use a little more
        practice. Repetition can improve your technique and refine your style. If for no other reason than this, I always keep my hands busy. This time I had three five-hundred-yen coins and eighteen hundreds in the one pocket, and seven fifties and
        sixteen tens in the other. Making a grand total of three-thousand eight-hundred-ten yen. Calculations like this are no trouble at all. Simpler than counting the fingers on my hands. Satisfied, I leaned back against the stainless-steel wall
        and looked straight ahead at the doors. Which were still not opening. What could be taking so long? I tentatively wrote off both the equipmentmalfunction theory and the forgotten-by-operator theory. Neither very realistic. This was not to say
        that equipment malfunction or operator negligence couldn't realistically occur. On the contrary, I know for a fact that such accidents are all too common in the real world. What I mean to say is that in a highly exceptional reality—this
        ridiculously slick elevator a case in point—the non-exceptional can, for convenience sake, be written off as paradoxically exceptional. Could any human being capable of designing this Tom Swift elevator fail to keep the machinery in working
        order or forget the proper procedures once a visitor stepped inside? The answer was obvious. No. Never happen. Not after they had been so meticulous up to that point. They'd seen to minute details, measuring each step I'd taken virtually to
        the millimeter. I'd been stopped by two guards at the entrance to the building, asked whom I was there to see, matched against a visitors' list, made to produce my driver's license, logged into a central computer for verification, after which
        I was summarily pushed into this elevator. You don't get this much going over when you visit the Bank of Japan. It was unthinkable that they, having done all that, should slip up now. The only possibility was that they had intentionally
        placed me in this particular situation. They wanted the elevator's motions to be opaque to me. They wanted the elevator to move so slow I wouldn't be able to tell if it were going up or down. They were probably watching me with a hidden TV
        camera now. To ward off the boredom, I thought about searching for the camera lens. But on second thought, what would I have to gain if I found it? That would alert them, they'd halt the elevator, and I'd be even later for my appointed hour.
        So I decided to do nothing. I was here in proper accordance with my duties. No need to worry, no cause for alarm. I leaned against the elevator wall, thrust my hands in my pockets, and once more counted my change. Three-thousand
        seven-hundred-fifty yen. Nothing to it. Done in a flash. Three-thousand seven-hundred-fifty yen? Something was wrong. I'd made a mistake somewhere. My palms began to sweat. In three years of counting, never once had I screwed up. This was a
        bad sign. I shut my eyes and made my right brain and left brain a blank, in a way you might clean your glasses. Then withdrawing both hands from my pockets, I spread my fingers to dry the sweat. Like Henry Fonda in Warlock, where he steels
        himself before a gun fight. With palms and fingers completely dry, both hands dived into my pockets to do a third count. If the third sum corresponded to either of the other sums I'd feel better. Everybody makes mistakes. Under the peculiar
        conditions I found myself, I may have been anxious, not to mention a little overconfident. That was my first mistake. Anyway, an accurate recount was all I needed to remedy the situation, to put things right. But before I could take the
        matter in hand, the elevator doors opened. No warning, no sound, they just slid open to either side.
